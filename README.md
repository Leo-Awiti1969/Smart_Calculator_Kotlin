# Smart_Calculator_Kotlin
## Learning outcomes
Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about lists, strings, and other data types. You will also get closer experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue.
## About
Smart Calculator is a graduate project for track Kotlin Basics.
Graduate projects contain core topics for this track. You need to apply core topics in project stages to verify your knowledge. At least one graduate project is required to complete the track.
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.
